# Hexen Co-Op

This is a simple script to make playing co-op games of Hexen easier on GZDoom. It currently only supports Windows (because I'm lazy), but I'm happy to support other OSs. Open an issue or a PR.

## Requirements

- GZDoom
- Python3

## Usage

Copy `HexenCoop.py` to your GZDoom folder, and run it by double-clicking or `python3 HexenCoop.py` and follow the prompts. Enjoy!
